By following this book, you will develop a clear understanding of pandas for data 
manipulation, machine learning, and in particular, supervised learning. There are 7 sections 
in this course with total 35 lectures. 


In **first section** we will discuss machine learning and types of machine learning. I have tried my 
best to explain the concept in simple and understandable language. 


In **second section** we will train our first machine learning model. This section contains 20 
lectures and we assure that if you take those all 20 lectures, you will have no confusion in 
rudimentary machine learning concepts. There is coding, written lectures and quizzes in this 
section. 


we have also covered all the fundamental steps of data science for your clarity, including 
exploring datasets, creating custom datasets, and understanding datasets for machine learning 
applications 


In **third section** we have trained model on another machine learning algorithm (linear 
regression). Working of linear regression, graphical understanding and basic math behind this 
algorithm is briefly explained. There are assignments for you, that will increase your confidence 
on your understandings. 


In **fourth section** we will train a ML model on famous dataset, iris dataset, containing feature of 
flowers. We will train a model which predicts category of a flower based on some features of 
flower (petal and sepal dimensions). 

In **fifth section**: Until now, accuracy of model was unknown, we were not having any idea how 
well our model works. We will discuss technique to check accuracy of our models in this section. 
I have explained very comprehensively how to evaluate performance of any of our machine 
learning model.  


We have checked the accuracy of our iris dataset machine learning model (which we trained in 
previous section), which is amazingly 97%.


In **sixth and last section** we will discuss another widely used machine learning algorithm 
(logistic regression). Using logistic regression we will train a model to predict whether a patient 
is suffering from diabetes or not. We will create our model that predicts whether a person have 
diabetes or not, with accuracy of almost 79%. 


In **seventh section** we have assembled all codes of this book in a single place where you can 
easily access code of any section from this book.
